Purplapp
========

[Purplapp](http://app.net/purplapp) is an app.net web statistics application.

### Current Features

Here are some things you can do with Purplapp at the moment:

* [Want to get some details on your account? Want to find out more about the PCA clubs you're in?](http://purplapp.eu/posts.php)
* [Want to see the PCA clubs you're in - in a format great to just copy into your bio?](http://purplapp.eu/pca.php)

### Future Features

Here are some future things we plan to develop in order:

1. Auto updating bio with your latest PCA clubs? Fully customisable (maybe)?
2. Want notifications on people about to hit CookieClub? What about other clubs too?

### Configuration

Put it on a server with PHP. :)

However, you will need to change the config.php file to include an access token:

```
<?php
define('ACCESS_TOKEN', 'ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE');
?>
```

Make sure you don't share this access token with anyone. You can get an access token from [@duerig's Dev Lite](http://dev-lite.jonathonduerig.com).
